### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
A couple challenges involved making sure that I was keeping track of all the different classes/subclasses and correct names and checkboxes so that the settings would be right and the app would run smoothly. I often got my initial view controller box unticked.

### Notes

A couple challenges encountered where with the installation of the cocoa pods because it was difficult since there wasnâ€™t a link to the cocoa pods installation. I think it would help if there was one there. Other than that the instructions were very thorough and helpful! Thanks.
